          <p>
            As a Junior Frontend Software Engineer, I am seeking my first job
            opportunity. I have been working on projects with JavaScript, but I
            am also open to adapting to other programming languages according to
            the hiring company's needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also aim to work in a healthy work environment, where there is
            respect and effective communication with my team, aiming to deliver
            projects within the established deadlines.
