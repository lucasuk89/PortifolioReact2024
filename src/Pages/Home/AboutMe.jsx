            Hey everyone!
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy reading books, playing video games, and soccer. I'm always
            eager to learn a new sport or activity. I've already completed 4
            half marathons and consider running as a sport that makes us use our
            minds to achieve our goals.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section--description">
            I'm someone who loves to interact both in the workplace and beyond.
            <br />I believe positivity is the key to building meaningful
            connections between people and creating a more peaceful work
            environment.
